## Facebook Checker

Facebook Checker is a Google Chrome extension written in TypeScript for the purposes of monitoring Facebook notifications, friend requests and inbox messages.
The application leverages JavaScript libraries JQuery and JQuery-UI, Chrome API, Bootstrap and templating framework Handlebars.

* Facebook Messages/Message Requests monitoring
* Desktop alerts
* Support for Mark as Read
* Recipient read status

### Installation:

Facebook Checker is a Visual Studio TypeScript solution and as such it first needs to be compiled into JavaScript before it can be used. This can be achieved in several ways (from VS, using tsc...) - see [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) website. 

Alternatively, you can download a prebuilt extension from the [Releases](https://github.com/dedocibula/facebook-checker/releases) page.

1. Download Facebook Checker from Github.
2. Extract Facebook Checker.
3. In Chrome type _chrome://extensions/_ in the URL field.
4. Enable/check _Developer mode_.
5. Click _Load unpacked extension_ and select root directory of the extracted Facebook Checker.
6. Enjoy :wink:.
